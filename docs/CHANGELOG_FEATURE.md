### Controller (`ChangelogController.php`)

public function index(): Response
{
    $releases = $this->getReleases();
    $currentVersion = $this->getCurrentVersion();

    return Inertia::render('Faculty/Changelog', [
        'releases' => $releases,
        'currentVersion' => $currentVersion,
    ]);
}
```

### Route Definition
```php
Route::get('/faculty/changelog', [FacultyChangelogController::class, 'index'])
    ->name('faculty.changelog');
```

### Vue Component Structure
```vue
<template>
  <FacultyLayout>
    <!-- Header with current version -->
    <!-- Release cards with structured content -->
    <!-- Footer with support links -->
  </FacultyLayout>
</template>
```

## Release Data Structure

Each release contains:
- **Version**: Semantic version number (e.g., v1.1.0)
- **Date**: Release date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Latest Flag**: Boolean indicating if this is the current version
- **Content**: HTML-formatted changelog content with:
  - Major features
  - Bug fixes
  - Technical improvements
  - User impact descriptions

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the Faculty dashboard
2. Click "Changelog" in the sidebar navigation
3. Browse through release versions
4. Read detailed information about each update

### For Developers
1. Update release data in `ChangelogController::getReleases()`
2. Add new release information following the existing structure
3. Update `getCurrentVersion()` method when releasing new versions

## Customization

### Adding New Releases
```php
private function getReleases(): array
{
    return [
        [
            'version' => 'v1.2.0',
            'date' => '2025-08-15',
            'isLatest' => true,
            'title' => 'New Feature Release',
            'description' => 'Brief description of the release',
            'features' => [...],
            'technical' => [...],
            'fixes' => [...]
        ],
        // ... existing releases
    ];
}
```

### Styling Customization
The component uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by modifying:
- Card layouts in the template
- Badge variants and colors
- Typography and spacing
- Responsive breakpoints

## Integration Points

### Navigation Menu
The changelog is integrated into the Faculty layout's secondary navigation:
```javascript
navSecondary: [
  {
    title: "Changelog",
    url: route("faculty.changelog"),
    icon: ScrollText,
    isActive: route().current("faculty.changelog"),
  },
  // ... other navigation items
]
```

### Route Protection
The changelog route inherits the same authentication and authorization as other faculty routes.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- **Search Functionality**: Search through changelog entries
- **Filtering**: Filter by release type (features, fixes, etc.)
- **RSS Feed**: Provide RSS feed for changelog updates
- **Email Notifications**: Notify users of new releases
- **Version Comparison**: Compare changes between versions
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatically sync with GitHub releases

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update release information when new versions are deployed
- Ensure release dates are accurate
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Test responsive design on various devices

### Content Guidelines
- Use clear, non-technical language for user-facing features
- Include technical details for developer-relevant changes
- Organize content logically (features â†’ fixes â†’ technical)
- Use consistent formatting and terminology
